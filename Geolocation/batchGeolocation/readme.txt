As discussed here is a short description of idea how to deal with vast number of accounts.

Unzip the folder, then run runme.cmd, this program will consume source.csv (one of 34 files in total). 
The file results.csv will create in the same folder.
Next upload results.csv onto SFDC using the map map.sdl.

It is important to keep geocoding_status on SFDC side (field already added on test env).
